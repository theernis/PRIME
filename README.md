# PRIME
a lot of prime numbers
in this repository you can find my generated prime number

# how to parse?
its all stored in binary form, so you need to read binary data from the file.
numbers in each file are stored a bit different:
8bits: 1 number takes 1 byte
16bits: 1 number takes 2 bytes
32bits: 1 number takes 4 bytes

# will i add higher bit count (like 64bits) files?
maybe, but its not my priority, 32bit numbers took me a week because of multiple mistakes and crashes.
